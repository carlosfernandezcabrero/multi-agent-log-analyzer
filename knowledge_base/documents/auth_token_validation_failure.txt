Error type: Auth token validation failure
Component: auth-service
Description:
Repeated failures during authentication token validation. This error typically manifests as "Failed to validate token" messages in the auth-service logs and may lead to intermittent or widespread login failures.
Historical incidents:
- INC-342: Clock skew between auth-service and identity provider caused ~30% login failures during peak hours
- INC-417: Misconfigured token TTL after deployment led to immediate token expiration
Recommended actions:
- Enforce time synchronization via NTP on all nodes
- Review and standardize token configuration across services
- Improve monitoring on authentication error rates
- Add alerting for sudden spikes in token validation failures
Severity guideline:
Medium to High, depending on impact and user-facing error rate.
